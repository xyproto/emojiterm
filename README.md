# Emojiterm [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xyproto/emojiterm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xyproto/emojiterm) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/xyproto/emojiterm)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/xyproto/emojiterm) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MPL2-brightgreen)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xyproto/emojiterm/master/LICENSE)

Want to find a suitable Emoji for use on GitHub, using only a terminal that supports 256 colors? Then this application is for you.

`emojiterm` can list all available emoji names, or search for a keyword and display the emoji directly on the terminal.

## Requirements

* Go >= 1.10.
* A terminal emulator that supports 256 colors.

## Installation

Install with your favorite package manager, if possible.

### Manual installation of the development version

    go get -u github.com/xyproto/emojiterm

## Supported terminal emulators

These terminal emulators are known to work:

* `konsole`
* `xfce4-terminal`

This one does not work:

* `urxvt`

This one works, but does not look quite right:

* `st`

## Request limit

If you reach the request limit for using the GitHub API, placing a valid token in the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable should solve the issue.

For generating a token, just visit [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and click "Generate new token". None of the boxes with extra access needs to be checked, since `emojiterm` only fetches emoji-related information.

When you have a token, you can display a slideshow of all available GitHub emojis, without reaching the request limit. Here's a command for this purpose:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="asdf"; for name in $(emojiterm -l); do emojiterm $name; done
```
